# yaba (yet another budgeting app)

## Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

#### Learning in public

#### An app which uses Plaid's APIs and allows users to track the balances and transactions for any financial institution they choose to link.

#### This is a work in progress and at this time, only the Android app is being developed as I am just starting to learn Swift.

The [backend]((https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server)) is using Plaid's sandbox api, so you can
only get fake data.

## Usage

There are two build types you can install, debug and staging, Staging requires you to run the server locally (link below), debug
does not.

Install your preferred flavor

````shell script
./gradlew installSandboxDebug
./gradlew installSandboxStaging 
````

Register with any email address you'd like, the format needs to be valid but nothing will be emailed
to you.

When linking an account, when prompted for a username and password for the financial institution,
the credentials are:

```
username: user_good
password: pass_good
pin: credential_good (when required)
MFA code: 1234 (when required)
```

Please see [Plaid sandbox test credentials](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/test-credentials/) for
MFA credentials if the institution you are attempting to link requires them.

## Prior Art

### [tivi by Chris Banes](https://github.com/chisbanes/tivi)

This project is a great example of how to build a large and stable project. I was greatly inspired
by Chris' state management technique and use some of his code, including Flow extensions, observers
and interactors. Credit is given where used.

### [KaMPKit by Touchlab](https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit)

Great starter template for KMM. I used the Koin setup logic as well as some Koin extensions.
