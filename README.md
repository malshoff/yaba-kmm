# yaba (yet another budgeting app) Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

An app which uses Plaid's APIs and allows users to track the balances and transactions for any financial institution they choose to link.

This is a work in progress and at this time, only the Android app is being developed as I am just starting to learn Swift.

The backend is using Plaid's sandbox api so you can only get fake data.

## Usage

Register with any email address you'd like, it just has to be a valid format.

When linking an account, when prompted for a username and password for the financial institution, the credentials are:

```
username: user_good
password: pass_good
```

[The backend is at https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server](https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server)
